    "One player starts by saying the number 1. \n",
    "Each player then takes it in turns to say the next number, counting one at a time. \n",
    "If the number is divisible by 3, instead of saying the number, the player should say, \"Fizz\". \n",
    "If the number is divisible by 5, instead of saying the number, the player should say, \"Buzz\". \n",
    "If the number is divisible by 3and5, instead of saying the number, the player should say, \"Fizz Buzz\". \n",
    "If you make a mistake, you're usually eliminated from the game, and the game continues until there's only \n",
    "a single player remaining. \n",
    "If there are no mistakes, the first 15 rounds of Fizz Buzz should look like this: \n",

    "For our version, we're only going to have a single player, the computer, and it's going to play the first 100 \n",
